# TODO

## High
- Ship v0.5.0 (`docs/release.md`). The declared home is measured
  (`docs/requirements-v1.md` section 7, 2026-09-21): no verdict moved that
  a random career already had, no cluster added, the wrong-profile verdict
  fired on 53 of 56 wrong declarations. What the field was built to lift —
  a majority-rule silence — occurred zero times in eighty random careers,
  so that claim stays unobserved; the only place it can be seen is a
  department cohort with a real declaration, which is the dpsd-new entry
  below. Its test gaps are closed (same day, 156 tests), and two of the
  new tests say in a comment why a below-floor fixture cannot prove the
  declared branch ran: both paths are silent there, so the sibling one
  work over the floor is the proof
- `resolve_author` reads one 25-row ORCID page and records a larger total
  without fetching the tail (`src/erga/openalex.py`), so "the declaration
  follows the person to every profile" is bounded by what the resolver
  materializes. Pre-existing and unrelated to `home:`, surfaced by the
  same review; decide whether the promise or the resolver should move
- Tell dpsd-new the field is in and what its config line looks like. They
  asked for it, and their pilot is the only place a real declaration and a
  known homonym coexist. Ask for one thing back: a build with `home:` set
  and the warnings it prints beside the undeclared run's, since a lifted
  silence or a wrong-profile verdict on a real department is the
  observation the random cohorts could not produce

## Normal
- Build-delta summary: diff the `publications.json` already at the output path
  against the new build and report what changed, with schema knowledge of which
  fields are cosmetic (cited_by_count) versus audit-critical — consumers need it
  to review a weekly PR too large for GitHub to render. Additive, so not a v1.0
  gate. Proposal received in f77de08; working spec
  `~/projects/dpsd-new/scripts/publications_summary.py`
  - Subsumes the parallel-run lesson: diff every schema field against an
    explicit ignore-list, not identity fields only
  - Name the partial-fetch hazard in the docs alongside it: a rate-limited
    fetch yields valid-but-smaller JSON that reads as mass removals
  - Undecided: stdout only or also an `action.yml` output; shrink guard in scope

## Low
- Two configured authors with different non-null `home:` values can resolve
  to one OpenAlex profile, and the later entry's declaration wins, as its
  name already does (`src/erga/pipeline.py`, the `declarations.update`).
  Neither the code nor section 5 defines that as the rule, so no test
  freezes it (Codex, `local/codex-test-gaps/notes.md`). Define it, or
  reject the overlap at config time with a message naming both entries
- Mint the moving `v1` tag with the 1.0 release; policy in docs/action.md
- Consumer recipes doc, unblocked now that a second consumer exists. Open it
  with the consumer contract: what erga asks of a consumer site (ORCID iDs,
  owned config, reviewed curation, API key at scale) and what it guarantees.
  Jekyll specifics are already in docs/action.md; the Astro recipe is thin
  (config-relative `src/data/erga.yml` → `publications.json`, imported at
  build time, no schema or convention change), and the empty-unlinked-ORCID
  case is the worked example to narrate. Also carry the discovery recipe
  dpsd-new measured, since finding an iD is the consumer's step: search
  OpenAlex under several Latinizations, read `last_known_institutions`,
  confirm the candidate's ORCID against orcid.org employment history, then
  scan the profile for the same-name-stranger shape. Their two traps are
  the cautionary examples (a person who signs "Xidias" where the staff
  record says "Xydias"; two Dimitris Zissis where the wrong one carries the
  right institution on OpenAlex)
- `erga suggest` (name and institution in, ranked candidate profiles out),
  proposed by dpsd-new and declined for v1 on 2026-09-02. The signal that
  separated both of their traps was orcid.org employment history, a second
  source the v1 non-goals exclude; a ranker without it puts the wrong Zissis
  first with confidence. Reopen if a third consumer hits the discovery wall,
  or when the sources non-goal is revisited after v1
- Surface no consumer has exercised yet, so unproven in the field before
  v1.0: `keep_distinct` overrides, thesis/software types in templates,
  keyless runs
- Publish a formal JSON Schema for the output and validate against it in
  tests (pre-v1.0): consumers get machine-checkable contract + generated
  types (Astro/TS)
- CSL-JSON and BibTeX emitters (before the v1.0 promotion push)
- Per-author review export (markdown per tracked author) so the maintainer
  can send each person their list for confirmation before publishing. A
  sibling of the other emitters; the consumer #2 pilot returned no input on
  it, so shape it from erga's side unless a consumer asks for something
- Year-cutoff knob (global; maybe per-author) as an output convenience, post-
  v1. Decided with consumer #2: fetch stays full-career, period views are the
  renderer's job; this knob would only spare consumers that filter
